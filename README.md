# sgRNA Design Scripts

Author: John S. Hawkins [really@gmail.com]

## Things you will need before you can run this code

* OS X (might run on Linux/Windows, but caveat emptor

* bowtie (not bowtie2)

* bowtie-build (should come with bowtie)

* Biopython

* pysam

## How to use this code

Primarily you will use

    build_sgrna_targets.py

which you can call with -h to learn about its flags.  The two required
arguments are

    input_fasta_genome_name [example -- testdata/test.fna]

and

    target_regions_file [example -- testdata/test_regions.tsv]

so to run on the sample files, you would call:

    ./build_sgrna_library.py --target_regions_file testdata/test_regions.tsv --input_fasta_genome_name testdata/doubletest.fna

**Important note:** The fna identifier for each block of DNA (chromosome or, in
the case of bacteria often the entire genome) must match the identifier in the
gff file.  Shockingly often, this is not the case, even when the gff and the
fasta come from the same source.  Try changing the identifier of your fasta
file (the identifier is the text following the '>' character on the first line
of each section) to match the identifier in your gff file before running these
scripts.

If you have a gff file and want to use all the genes, you can try using
(possibly with some modification)

    extract_gff_to_genes.py

## IGNORE THE REST, REFERS TO CURRENTLY UNMAINTAINED SCRIPT

Once you have created your target list with the build function, you can either
search the file manually for your gene of interest, or run

    subselect_sgrna_library.py

which groups the sgrna targets by gene and calls a chosen function to choose a
subset for a final library.
